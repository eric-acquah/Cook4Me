Cook4Me

This is an app that attempts to solve tiny problems in society that tends to
greatly hinder productivity. This app is a platform that offers an opportunity
for people who are willing and able to offer domestic services such as cooking
to people who need such services. So on this app, people who need to make customized
orders to a cook of their choice can come on the platform and find the exact cook who
suits their preferences. It also means that individuals registered as cooks can promte
themselves well enough to get contracts from clients easily.

This project is built by Eric Acquah and Chioma Ukora as part of our portfolio project
at ALX Software Engineering School.


Architecture

We aimed at building a more scalable app that can withstand explosive growth, therefore
we decided to go with the Three-tier app architecture. This application architecture is proven
to be much easier to manage and highly scalable, these are qualities of app architecture we greatly
desired for successfully building this project. Below is a rough sketch out of our design.

In the design we keep every major aspect of the app on a distinct platform, making it easier to manage.
